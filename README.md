# JapaneseTrainer
Simple application for training Japanese alphabets made with JavaFX

Actually (31.07.20) app allows chose Hiragana/Katakana or both, you have to type name of letter in romanji.

Ready, compiled app can be downloaded [HERE!](https://github.com/patrykk-dev/JapaneseTrainer/blob/master/japaneseTrainer-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

My todo:
- Organize controllers classes
- Add timer
- Improve UI
- Add some kanji (?)
